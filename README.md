# Open-Source Memecoin Market Maker

This project is an **open-source, free-to-use market making framework** designed for memecoins and other micro-cap assets.

It is built to be **modular, transparent, and easy to integrate** into your own trading systems, bots, dashboards, or research pipelines.

## What This Is (and Is Not)

### ✅ What it *is*
- A **market making / liquidity provision framework**
- Inventory-aware quoting logic
- Risk controls (position, notional, loss limits)
- Simulator + paper trading environment
- Exchange / venue-agnostic architecture

### ❌ What it is *not*
- Not a guaranteed profit system
- Not a plug-and-print money bot
- Not intended for spoofing, wash trading, or manipulation

This project is for **legitimate liquidity provision, research, and engineering**.

## Designed for Integration

This repository is intentionally structured so it can be:
- Imported as a library
- Used as a standalone bot
- Embedded into larger trading systems
- Extended with custom venues (CEX or DEX)
- Adapted for memecoins, microcaps, or experimental markets

The core logic is **decoupled** from execution so you can bring your own:
- Order routing
- Wallet management
- RPC / WebSocket feeds
- Risk overlays

---

## Automated Site (Coming Soon)

An **automated web interface** is currently in development.

Planned features include:
- Strategy configuration via UI
- Backtesting & simulation visualization
- Performance metrics
- Deployment helpers
- Documentation & examples

The site will remain **optional** — the core engine will always stay **open-source and usable without it**.

## Philosophy

Transparency > hype  
Composable > closed  
Research > promises  

This repo exists to give builders, traders, and projects a **clean foundation** for market making — not to sell signals or gatekeep infrastructure.
